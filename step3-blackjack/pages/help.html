    <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color:#9fd49f">Objective</h3>
    <p>Beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:#9fd49f">Card Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>&diams; Cards 2â€“10 are worth their face value</li>
      <li>&clubs; Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10</li>
      <li>&hearts; Aces are worth 1 or 11 (whichever works best for your hand)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color:#9fd49f">Gameplay</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place your bet using the chips at the bottom</li>
      <li>You and the dealer will each receive two cards</li>
      <li>One of the dealer's cards remains face down</li>
      <li>Choose to Hit, Stand, or Double Down to play your hand</li>
      <li>The dealer will play their hand according to fixed rules</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 style="color:#9fd49f">Player Actions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Take another card</li>
      <li><strong>Stand:</strong> End your turn with your current hand</li>
      <li><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your bet and receive exactly one more card</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color:#9fd49f">Strategy Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      The recommendation system helps you make optimal decisions based on basic 
      blackjack strategy. This is a mathematically calculated approach that gives 
      you the best odds against the house.
    </p>
    
    <div class="strategy-tip">
      <p><span class="key-concept">To use recommendations:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the lightbulb icon on the left side of the table to toggle recommendations on/off</li>
        <li>When enabled, you'll see a suggestion bubble showing the statistically best move</li>
        <li>The recommended action button will also be highlighted</li>
        <li>Recommendations update automatically after each new card is dealt</li>
        <li>You can also enable/disable recommendations in the Settings menu</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following basic strategy won't guarantee wins on every hand, but it optimizes your chances over time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><em>Note: When you have 21, the system will always recommend Stand (and prevent Hit/Double).</em></p>
